# BlockilyRainbowHat

A project to program the Rainbow HAT on Android Thing on the device using Blockly

# Steps of the project

- Configure an Activity that exposes the Rainbow HAT to a WebView
- Create and run custom code on that WebView
- Include Blockly as the default view on the app
- Create special blocks to interact with the Rainbow HAT components
- Generate code from blockly into javascript and execute it on the webview

That should be enough to allow the creation of Blockly projects on the device that run on the device.
